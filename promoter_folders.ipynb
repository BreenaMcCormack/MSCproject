    "- some seqeunces extracted were less than 50 bp, this was due to lack of sequencing; these sequences were at the end of the contig therefore the full 50 bp could not be extracted. This script iterates through my promoter_seqs folder, reads into each file and for each entry if the sequence is 50 bp it gets extracted and placed into a new folder (cured_promoter_seqs), and if the sequence is less than 50bp it gets extracted and placed into a separate folder (short_seqs). \n"
